# Project 1.0 for finding lanes in road

# Overview
This is my attempt to give something back to the online community and transfer the knowledge, experience to help creative,
innovative persons. I plan to provide a tutorial on the basics of road lane detection. 
I would start with basic algorithm and move to more complex alorithms for tacking challenging conditions.
I do plan to present one of the state of the art algorithms in this series where i will describe present one of my published work.
But for now let's get started with one of the basic algorithms.
